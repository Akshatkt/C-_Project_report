In this project Multi-Destination Navigation Optimization Algorithm is an efficient algorithmic solution designed to optimize routes for scenarios where a delivery agent needs to start and end at the same location while visiting multiple destinations. Utilizing the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, the solver intelligently constructs a tour, minimizing travel distance and enhancing efficiency. The accompanying Graphical User Interface (GUI) ensures user-friendly interaction, while performance optimizations make it effective for small to medium-sized instances. This project is a versatile tool with applications in logistics, delivery services, and route planning, offering a practical solution to multi-destination navigation challenges.
